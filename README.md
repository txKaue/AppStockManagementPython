# App Stock Management Using Python and Microservices

I made an simple app to manage stock using Python.
The project actually is two projects. First i made an OOP normal project just to manage stock, then the second project I made it using microservices.

## SimpleProject folder:

This is the folder of the OOP project. We have 3 files:

- main.py : The main file that have to be executed.
- Produtos.py: My class and methods to create and manage a product.
- Stock.py: My class and methods to create and manage a stock.
